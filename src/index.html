    <p> The late Prof. Dora Nkem Akunyili (July 1954 - 2004) was the

    <p> An embodiment of wisdom, charisma, eloquence, intelligence,
        filled with so much compassion for her country, a bundle of energy.
    </p>
<!--Body of the Tribute III-->
    <p> Late Prof. Dora Akunyili stood for the right things till her dying days 
        one woman who stood at the frontline to combat against fake drugs, illicit 
        consumption of drugs,not one to twist the truth to soothe your fragile ego, 
        she was a huge pin in the neck of malicious and dubious folks in the country. </p>
<!--Body of the tribute IV-->
    <p> She was never afraid to confront the guilty ones irrespective of personal affiliations, one who was dogged,
    fearless, bold, and audaciously brutal with the TRUTH! 
    If being fearless, audacious, bold, resilient were a face, Dora Akunyili wore 
    the look to perfection. </p>
